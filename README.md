My own copy of working with GOTM simulation, forked from [Fox-Kemper Lab](https://gitlab.com/fox-kemper_lab/gotmwork.git).

* To make the tools and paths accessible everywhere regardless of `pwd`:

  `ln -s <path to gotmwork repo>/set_tools.sh /usr/local/bin/set_tools_gotm`
  `source set_tools_gotm` will then activate the paths and tools.
